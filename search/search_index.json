This guide provides all the necessary information to get started with Magewire V3, understand its core concepts, and build dynamic Magento applications using Livewire-like components.</p> <p>Understanding Magewire Documentation and Its Relation to Livewire</p> <p>Magewire is heavily inspired by Livewire, and as a result, most of its core functionality works in the same way. For this reason, all essential documentation can be found in the official Livewire documentation. The Magewire documentation primarily focuses on Magento-specific implementations, custom features, and additional explanations that are either missing from the Livewire docs or are not relevant due to platform differences. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of how Magewire works under the hood, we highly recommend referring to the Livewire documentation alongside this guide.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#what-is-magewire","title":"What is Magewire?","text":"<p>MagewirePHP is a powerful framework for Magento 2 that enables developers to build reactive and dynamic user interfaces without writing JavaScript. It is inspired by Laravel Livewire and offers a similar development experience within the Magento ecosystem.</p> <p>Magewire comes with Alpine JS preloaded as the primary JavaScript engine behind the framework. If you are using Alpine JS within your theme, make sure to disable your version to prevent it from being loaded twice, as this can cause conflicts.</p> <p>Each theme should have its own submodule on top of Magewire to ensure compatibility. Theme-specific modifications, such as custom events and loading files, are required for proper functionality. By default, Magewire is built on the Hyv\u00e4 theme, but this integration can easily be disabled, as it is a separate compatibility module rather than part of the core architecture.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#so-much-more","title":"So Much More","text":"<p>Both Livewire and Magewire are known for their dynamic capabilities powered by XHR (AJAX) requests.

There are many new features like Fragments, which let you mark sections in your PHTML and tweak them using modifiers. Fragments came about because of CSP\u2014I wanted a tool I could wrap around a <code>script</code> block and then optionally modify based on different variables, like adding a <code>nonce</code> attribute or creating a hash of the content and passing it to Magento's CSP collection. I've expanded this concept to offer other fragments in the future. You could think of feature flags, for example where you can show part of your PHTML only based on a specific version of another package.</p> <p>There's also a new <code>@</code> compiler that allows you to use so-called <code>@</code>-directives in your PHTML that automatically get converted to valid PHP during compilation. This creates cleaner, more readable PHTML, but also means less actual PHP code in the PHTML files. There's much less need for all kinds of View Models and Helpers to get things done. I have some really exciting ideas in the pipeline for this feature that I hope to add soon. The groundwork is already laid.</p> <p>Of course, the completely new documentation shouldn't be forgotten either. I'm glad I set this up because I can now write about things much more specifically compared to the previous approach where everything was buried on a single page in the Magewire repository itself.

Templates are automatically recompiled whenever a <code>.phtml</code> file is modified, ensuring changes are always up to date.</p> <ul> <li>Template Fragments</li> </ul> <p>Provides the ability to mark a specific area within a template, allowing modifiers to alter its content\u2014such as   making inline scripts CSP compliant. This is done using the <code>$fragment = $viewModel-&gt;utils()-&gt;template()-&gt;fragment()</code> chain,   followed by <code>$script = $fragment-&gt;script()-&gt;start()</code> and <code>$script-&gt;end()</code> to define the fragment boundaries.</p> <p>For more details, please refer to the Fragments documentation.</p> <ul> <li>Automatic View Model Resolving</li> </ul> <p>Blocks that are direct or indirect children of the magewire block will automatically receive a <code>view_model</code> argument\u2014as   long as it hasn\u2019t already been manually defined. This reduces the need to explicitly bind the <code>view_model</code> to each individual block,   resulting in cleaner and more maintainable layout XML.</p> <p>For more details, please refer to the Notables documentation.</p> <ul> <li>Portman</li> </ul> <p>A tool that enables developers to port packages from other communities into Magento, making it possible to reuse a   wide range of existing code and reduce duplication across ecosystems.</p> <p>For more details, please refer to the Portman documentation.</p> <ul> <li>CSP Complaint</li> </ul> <p>Since April 2025, it is recommended that all payment-related functionality is CSP compliant\u2014meaning that any scripts,   styles, or other resources involved in the payment process must adhere to Content Security Policy standards.</p> <p>This includes using <code>nonces</code> or <code>hashes</code> for inline scripts and ensuring that all external resources are loaded from trusted,   whitelisted domains. Doing so enhances the security of the checkout process and helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</p> <ul> <li>Components Hooks</li> </ul> <p>Compared to V1, Magewire V3 introduces a wide range of new extension points throughout the backend architecture.   Developers can now hook into various stages of the component lifecycle\u2014including rendering, hydration, dehydration,   and more\u2014making it easier to customize and extend Magewire's behavior in powerful and flexible ways.</p> <ul> <li>View Model Utilities</li> </ul> <p>The primary Magewire ViewModel has been extended with a <code>utils</code> API, giving developers easy access to commonly used   tools\u2014both within and outside Magewire component template files. This eliminates the need to repeatedly create custom   ViewModels for basic functionality.</p> <p>The <code>utils</code> API is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add custom utilities when needed.   However, in most cases, it should already provide everything you need out of the box.</p>"},{"location":"pages/html-directives/wire-click.html","title":"wire:click","text":"<p>Laravel Livewire Documentation Reference</p> <p>Since Magewire is heavily inspired by Laravel Livewire, many concepts are either identical or very similar.
