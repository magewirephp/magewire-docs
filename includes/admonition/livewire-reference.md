!!! tip "Laravel Livewire Documentation Reference"
    Since Magewire is heavily inspired by Laravel Livewire, many concepts are either identical or very similar. To avoid duplicating documentation, this page only covers Magewire-specific and platform-specific details. For all general concepts and in-depth explanations, you can refer to the corresponding Laravel Livewire documentation.
