# Documentation

Magewire is heavily inspired by Livewire, and as a result, most of its core functionality works in the same way.
For this reason, all essential documentation can be found in the official [Livewire documentation](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/quickstart).

The Magewire documentation primarily focuses on Magento-specific implementations, custom features,
and additional explanations that are either missing from the Livewire docs or are not relevant due to platform differences.

If you're looking for a deeper understanding of how Magewire works under the hood, we highly recommend referring to the
Livewire documentation alongside this guide.

## Structure

The Magewire documentation is intentionally structured in a way that closely follows the Livewire documentation.
This has been done to create a sense of familiarity, making navigation more intuitive and helping users better
understand how different concepts relate to each other. If you're already familiar with Livewire,
you should find it easy to adapt to Magewire.

To avoid unnecessary duplication, pages that exist in both the Magewire and Livewire documentation will always include
a direct link to the corresponding Livewire page for quick access. The Magewire documentation will only contain
additional information specific to Magewire, such as Magento-specific implementations, platform-specific limitations,
and custom features.

We deliberately avoid copying and pasting content from the Livewire documentation. Instead, our goal is to complement
it with details that are unique to Magewire, ensuring you get the most relevant and accurate information without redundancy.

!!! info "Quick link"
    On certain pages in this documentation, you will find a button labeled "View Livewire Docs" (or a similar title). This button serves as a direct link to the corresponding page in the official Livewire documentation.

    Whenever you see this button, it means the topic being discussed is largely the same in both Magewire and Livewire. Clicking it will take you to the original Livewire documentation, where you can find in-depth explanations, examples, and additional details.

    The Magewire documentation will only cover Magento-specific differences, custom features, or enhancements that are not present in Livewire. This approach helps avoid content duplication while ensuring you always have access to the most relevant information.

## Clarity

I strive to keep this documentation as clean and clear as possible. This means that, in most cases, page titles will
consist of a single word rather than a full sentence. Titles are carefully chosen to be self-explanatory,
ensuring that readers can quickly understand the topic at a glance.

The goal is to make navigation intuitive and to avoid unnecessary complexity. By keeping titles concise,
it becomes easier to scan through the documentation and find the information you need without distractions.
If a topic requires further clarification, the content of the page itself will provide the necessary details.
