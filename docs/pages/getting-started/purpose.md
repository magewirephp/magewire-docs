Magento is no longer the "sexy" platform it once was when it comes to PHP, architecture, and development approaches.
This is understandable, as the platform has aged, and certain concepts are difficult to modernize without significant restructuring.

Fortunately, over the years, alternatives have emerged that introduce more modern, streamlined development
techniques—especially on the frontend. Magewire follows a similar path, leveraging its architecture to introduce unique
features and concepts without deviating from Magento’s core principles.

## More then a Port

Magewire is more than just a [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/){:target="_blank"} port; it draws inspiration from Laravel,
particularly its simplicity. While Magewire primarily focuses on enabling dynamic component development,
it also includes a range of enhancements that accelerate Magento feature development and improve the developer experience.

## Shake Things Up

Magewire aims to shake things up by introducing modern, innovative concepts. Yes, this requires a different approach to
development, but everything within a Magewire component is entirely optional.
Traditional Magento workflows remain fully supported.

By modernizing Magento’s development experience, Magewire seeks to (also) attract a new generation of developers who prefer a
more streamlined approach. Simplifying certain Magento concepts makes backend development more approachable and enjoyable.

## The Long Term

Magewire is a comprehensive package packed with powerful features. With version 3, the goal is to become a default
choice for both frontend and backend developers—whether for use within themes or to build admin panel features.

While Magewire’s future depends on love, contributions and financial support, it has the potential to revolutionize backend development.
Together with cutting-edge frontend capabilities such as [Hyvä](https://hyva.io?ref=magewire-documentation),
Magento can regain its "sexy" status—it just requires fresh minds open to change.
