Magento has evolved over time, and certain aspects of its PHP architecture and development approach may not align with
current trends. This is understandable, given the platform's age and the challenges of modernizing certain concepts
without extensive restructuring.

In recent years, alternatives have emerged that offer more modern and streamlined development techniques,
particularly on the frontend. Magewire takes a similar approach, leveraging its architecture to introduce new features
and concepts while trying to stay somewhat aligned with Magento's core principles.

## More then a Port

Magewire is more than just a [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/){:target="_blank"} port; it draws inspiration from Laravel,
particularly its simplicity. While Magewire primarily focuses on enabling dynamic component development,
it also includes a range of enhancements that accelerate Magento feature development and improve the developer experience.

## Shake Things Up

Magewire aims to shake things up by introducing modern, innovative concepts. Yes, this requires a different approach to
development, but everything within a Magewire component is entirely optional.
Traditional Magento workflows remain fully supported.

By modernizing Magento’s development experience, Magewire seeks to (also) attract a new generation of developers who prefer a
more streamlined approach. Simplifying certain Magento concepts makes backend development more approachable and enjoyable.

## The Long Term

Magewire is a powerful, feature-rich package with a bold vision for the future. With version 3, we aim to make it the
default choice for both frontend and backend developers—whether for use in themes or to build dynamic admin panel features.

The future of Magewire lies in the passion, contributions, and support of its community. It has the potential to redefine
backend development and reshape the way developers interact with Magento.

Combined with forward-thinking frontend solutions like [Hyvä](https://hyva.io?ref=magewire-documentation){:target="_blank"}, Magewire can help Magento
reclaim or push forward its place at the forefront of modern development—ushering in a new era driven by fresh ideas and
a willingness to embrace change.
