# Architecture

Considerable research was conducted to devise a practical and comprehensible approach to porting Livewire into a Magento module,
while maintaining a straightforward architecture to encourage broader contribution.

## Module structure

The module structure differs slightly from a typical Magento module.

| Directory   | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `./dist`    | The classes generated by **Portman** are based on the configuration source and any overrides, following a similar folder structure to the one found in the `./portman` directory. |
| `./lib`     | Contains framework-related classes, including core Features and Mechanisms.                                                                                                       |
| `./portman` | Specific **Portman** class overwrites.                                                                                                                                            |
| `./src`     | Core structure serving as the initial entry point, binding key elements to Magento.                                                                                               |
| `./tests`   | Multiple type of tests e.g. Playwright                                                                                                                                            |
| `./themes`  | Theme support decided into sub-modules                                                                                                                                            |

## Theme Support

Magewire is build to support multiple themes with having the Hyvä theme as its default. A theme needs to be made compatible adding or overwriting
specific theme related code re-using the javascript which is written in a modular and loosly coupled fashion.

### Example

Among other things, some theme-specific adjustments for Hyvä were necessary — in this example, the flash messages are being made compatible.

```html title="page/js/magewire/features/support-magento-flash-messages.phtml"
 <script>
    (() => {
        window.addEventListener('magewire:flash-messages:dispatch', event => {
            dispatchMessages(event.detail)
        })
    })()
</script>
```

The `magewire:flash-messages:dispatch` event is triggered by the **MagentoFlashMessages** feature. An array containing a
`name` and its corresponding `params`, in this case, the flash messages extracted from the component during dehydration,
is pushed into the `dispatches` property.

```php title="Magewirephp\Magewire\Features\SupportMagentoFlashMessages\SupportMagentoFlashMessages"
<?php

$context->pushEffect('dispatches', [
    'name'   => 'magewire:flash-messages:dispatch',
    'params' => $messages,
]);
```
