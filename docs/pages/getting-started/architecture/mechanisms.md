# Mechanisms

Magewire is divided into three aspects. First, there is the architecture itself, which includes the module responsible
for loading everything within Magento, as well as specific Livewire concepts. Those other two aspects within this architecture
are **Features** and **Mechanisms**.

In this documentation, we will focus specifically on **Mechanisms**.
