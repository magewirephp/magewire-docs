# Sponsoring

The purpose of open-source sponsorship should never be seen as begging for money. It is always voluntary and cannot be
tied to any obligations. Instead, it is a way to show appreciation for a project that provides meaningful benefits
to you as a developer or to your company.

Magewire is entirely driven by volunteers who dedicate their free time to the project. Their contributions are not
motivated by financial gain but by a desire to enhance their skills, improve a package they rely on in their daily work,
thrives their business and/or create better software. Sponsorship is always on an individual basis,
as this project is independent of any company or organization.
