# Beta

!!! danger "Beta release"
    **Do not use Magewire V3 in production, as its stability, security, and overall reliability cannot be guaranteed.
    The framework is still in an beta phase, and breaking changes may occur without warning.
    Using it in a live environment is entirely at your own risk and may lead to unexpected issues, including potential
    security vulnerabilities and system instability.**

As of June 1st, the Magewire V3 Beta has been officially released for testing.

This beta version gives developers an opportunity to explore what's new, what has changed, and what updates may be
required to ensure compatibility with their existing implementations.

We encourage you to try out the beta, provide feedback, and report any issues you encounter. Your input helps shape a stable and reliable final release.

## Rough State

Magewire V3 is still in a rough beta state, meaning that while the core architecture is in place, many features still
need to be fine-tuned and battle-tested before the package can be considered stable.

One of the key goals during this phase is to increase test coverage to ensure that no bugs slip through when new
releases are published.

That said, the beta tag also signals that the overall architecture is solid and unlikely to undergo major changes,
as it largely follows the structure of Livewire. The foundation is there—but it still needs polish and real-world
feedback before it's production-ready.

## Work In Progress

Some pages or sections are marked with `WIP...`, indicating that they are important areas requiring further attention
and should or will be completed soon.

## GitHub Discussions

We encourage developers to actively contribute to the project. If you discover a bug, please consider submitting a pull request with a fix.

Alternatively, you can start a discussion in the GitHub repository—just make sure to include as many details as possible
to help us understand and reproduce the issue.

For feature ideas or proposals, we welcome discussions as well. To help us organize and track ideas related to the upcoming version,
please prefix your GitHub discussion title with `[V3]`. 

## Duration of the Beta

There is no fixed timeline for how long the beta will last.

However, a key milestone is to implement all features that Magewire V1 offered, enabling existing projects to migrate smoothly to V3.
The beta may conclude once these goals are achieved.
