# Sponsors

MagewirePHP is not a company or foundation but relies primarily on volunteers who dedicate their free time to
developing the project. If you’re willing to sponsor, either as a one-time contribution or on a recurring basis,
this is possible on a personal level—depending on the developer and whether they accept sponsorships.

A huge thank you to all the amazing sponsors! Every contribution is truly appreciated, and those who have given more are featured higher on this list as a special thank-you for their extra support.

## Growing Together Through Open Source

MagewirePHP started as a small experiment, but thanks to an incredible community of developers, agencies, and merchants, it has quickly evolved into a widely used package. The enthusiasm and support from all of you have driven its growth, making it an essential tool in many projects.

As interest in MagewirePHP has grown, so has the need for continuous development. Keeping up with this demand requires a significant investment of time and effort—something that has been fueled purely by passion.

## The Power of Reinvestment
Already some successful (commercial) projects have been built on MagewirePHP, proving just how valuable open-source innovation can be. However, the idea of giving back—whether through contributions, sponsorships, or other forms of support—is still something that’s developing within our commercially driven industry.

Brilliant ideas emerge all the time, but too often, they struggle to reach their full potential due to limited time and financial resources. Thankfully, some companies and individuals recognize the value of open source and actively contribute, understanding that by supporting innovation, they’re also helping themselves stay ahead and deliver better solutions.

## Looking Ahead
So far, MagewirePHP has been maintained in our free time, with a few generous sponsors providing small one-time or recurring contributions. We are truly grateful for this support! However, to sustain development at the current pace—or even accelerate it—we need to find a more sustainable approach.

To ensure MagewirePHP continues to thrive, we see two possible paths forward:

- Expanding the team with more volunteers, making sure that development efforts are shared and sustainable.
- Securing additional financial support through sponsorships, allowing us to dedicate more time to improving and expanding MagewirePHP.

With Magewire V3, we’re making a final, dedicated push to ensure MagewirePHP remains a success for years to come. If Magewire has helped you or your business, now is the time to help shape its future. Together, we can keep this project strong and continue to build something amazing.
