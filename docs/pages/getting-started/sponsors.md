| **Vendic** | Fast, reliable Magento 2 webshops for everyone.                                                                     | [:fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://vendic.nl/?ref=magewire-documentation){:target="_blank"}       |
| **Zero-1** | Focussed on multi use code (commercial and private extensions), which reduces TCO, and increases ROI for merchants. | [:fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://www.zero1.co.uk/?ref=magewire-documentation){:target="_blank"} |

MagewirePHP is not a company or foundation but relies primarily on volunteers who dedicate their free time to
developing the project. If you’re willing to sponsor, either as a one-time contribution or on a recurring basis,
this is possible on a personal level—depending on the developer and whether they accept sponsorships.

Below, you’ll find a list of all volunteers and a link to sponsor.

## Statement

!!! info "Disclaimer"
    **The following reflects my personal (Willem Poortman, founder of MagewirePHP) opinion and perspective on the state of open-source sustainability within the Magento community.
    It is intended as constructive feedback for the community and a call to action for those who benefit from MagewirePHP. 
    My goal is to highlight the challenges we face and encourage meaningful support for continued innovation.**

MagewirePHP started as a small-scale experiment but quickly grew into a widely used package,
embraced by thousands of developers, agencies, and merchants.
As interest surged, so did the demand for continuous development, requiring a significant
investment of time—driven purely by passion.

Over the years, MagewirePHP has gradually gained recognition, partly due to its role as the
foundation for several large commercial projects. Many of these projects, along with freelance developers and agencies,
rely heavily on MagewirePHP and have successfully built profitable businesses around it.

### Reinvest

However, the concept of giving back—reinvesting into open source—is still in its early stages within our largely
commercially driven community. While many passionate developers bring forward incredible ideas, too often,
these ideas fade away due to a lack of time and financial resources.

Fortunately, not everyone follows this pattern. Some companies recognize the immense value of open source,
understanding that by supporting innovation and nurturing talent, they ultimately accelerate their ability
to meet customer demands and drive progress.

### Future

So far, MagewirePHP has been developed primarily in our free time, with the support of a handful of sponsors who have made small one-time or recurring contributions. While we are incredibly grateful for this support, the reality is that it is nowhere near enough to sustain development at the current pace. The time investment required compared to the financial backing is simply not sustainable.

There are two possible solutions:

1. Expanding the team with more volunteers to distribute the workload, ensuring that the responsibility for ongoing development doesn’t rest solely on one or two individuals.
2. Securing additional financial support through sponsorships to help fund further development.

Magewire V3 represents the final attempt—after four years of personal investment—to make a project of this scale truly successful. The era of benefiting from Magewire without giving back cannot continue indefinitely. True entrepreneurs must recognize that without the innovation Magewire provides, many of their achievements would not have been possible.
