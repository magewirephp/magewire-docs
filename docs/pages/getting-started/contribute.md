# Contribute

!!! info "Magewire is a completely independent framework, unaffiliated with any organization or company."

These docs are constantly evolving, requiring updates and improvements as the framework gains new features.
That’s why we encourage users to spot typos, fill in missing details, or clarify unclear sections by contributing.

Writing good documentation is a skill in itself—one that takes time to master. It requires a deep understanding of a
feature and the ability to explain it concisely yet clearly, providing enough information for others to grasp it at a glance.

## Why Contribute

Contributing to an open-source project comes with many benefits. It’s not just about investing your free time—you also
gain valuable skills and knowledge along the way.

Some benefits of contributing to an open-source project include:

- Learning from others
- Refining your skills
- Giving and receiving feedback
- Expanding your portfolio
- Improving job market opportunities
- Networking and building connections

## Your Contributions Matter

Every developer has faced that moment—the hesitation, the self-doubt, the feeling of being overwhelmed when stepping
beyond their comfort zone to contribute. Thoughts like _Am I good enough?_ _What if I make mistakes?_ or
_Others are smarter than me_ can spiral into inaction, stopping you from making the changes that could improve not only
your workflow but the project as a whole.

But here’s the truth: **every contribution matters**, **no matter your experience level**. We welcome all contributions,
big or small, because each one gives us valuable insight into how developers interact with the framework.
Your perspective helps us identify gaps in the documentation, refine features, and even spark new ideas and innovations.

Not every pull request will be merged instantly, but every submission will be reviewed and acknowledged.
We’ll provide feedback, guide you where needed, and sometimes even refine your work so you can learn from the process.

So take that step—your contributions make a difference.
We’re excited to see what you bring to the table!
