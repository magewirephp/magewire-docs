# Contribute

!!! info "Magewire is a completely independent framework, unaffiliated with any organization or company."

These docs are constantly evolving, requiring updates and improvements as the framework gains new features.
That’s why we encourage users to spot typos, fill in missing details, or clarify unclear sections by contributing.

Writing good documentation is a skill in itself—one that takes time to master. It requires a deep understanding of a
feature and the ability to explain it concisely yet clearly, providing enough information for others to grasp it at a glance.
