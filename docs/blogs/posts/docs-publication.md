## Kicking Off a New Chapter for Magewire

First, I’m excited to share that starting today, all future updates about Magewire will be posted right here in
the blog section of the documentation.

This shift is all about keeping things simple and centralized. No more jumping between websites to find the latest news
or resources—everything you need will now live alongside the docs.

## The Wait Is (Kind of) Over!

For those who’ve been patiently waiting: the long silence is finally breaking—at least in terms of documentation.

I’ve spent months putting together the foundation, and while there’s still some work to be done,
I’ve decided to release the docs ahead of the actual beta launch.

My goal is to give you a head start—to inspire, to motivate, and to let you explore what's coming in Magewire V3.

The beta code itself is planned for release by June 1st. I just need a few more evening sessions to get it over the finish line.

## A Work in Progress (Literally)

Let me be upfront: the documentation is still very much a work in progress.

You’ll see a few `WIP...` tags sprinkled throughout. These are simply placeholders and reminders for myself—sections that still need attention.

## Why This Release Matters

The main goal right now is to help developers get started with V3 as early as possible. By putting the documentation out there,
I’m hoping to lay the groundwork for the community to join in and help shape its future.

That said, this is still a passion project—one I mostly work on during evenings and weekends—so progress might not always be rapid.
Thanks in advance for your patience and understanding.

## What’s Next?

In about a week, I’ll push the V3 beta under a new beta tag in the Magewire GitHub repository (which you probably already know your way around).

From there, things become a little less predictable. The pace of development will depend on a lot of factors,
including time, feedback, and community involvement.

Thanks for being part of this journey. Let’s make something awesome together.
